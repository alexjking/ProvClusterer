ProvClusterer
=============

ProvClusterer is an itneractive tool to create a simplified view of a W3C PROV document.
 
This tool identifies clusters of elements within a document using thee Girvan-Newman community clustering algorithm.
Each group of elements can be collapsed into a single element resulting in a smaller and less complex document.

This was created by Alexander King as part of a third year project submitted for MEng Computer Science at the
University of Southampton and is built using the ProvToolbox which provides an implementation of the PROV specification.
